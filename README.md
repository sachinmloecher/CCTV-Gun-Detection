# CCTV-Gun-Detection

The average duration of active shooter incidents is 12.5 minutes. Data show victim survival rates fall by 7-10% for every minute without emergency treatment. The purpose of this project is to attempt to demonstrate how we could use Computer Vision to decrease the duration of such incidents and save lives by detecting firearms before they are used.

The goals of this project include computer vision model development, deployment, and live demonstration using real cameras. Our dataset consists of 4471 annotated images of firearms and shooting incidents.
